Awsome Ingestion
=====

In this repository, we demonstrate how to ingest data from various sources into FAISS vector storage. We combine different approaches using the Llama-Index and LangChain. The focus is not on determining the superiority of algorithms or libraries; rather, it serves as a demonstration of data ingestion into FAISS. Additionally, there are RAG classes to generate descriptions for different indices.
